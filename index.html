<h3>AIR QUALITY INDEX</h3>
<p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells us how clean or polluted air is.

</p>

<p>
The AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutant measured over a standard time interval (24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for carbon monoxide and ozone).<br> For example, the AQI for PM2.5 is based on 24-hour average concentration

<h3>How AQI is influenced by Climatic Conditions.</h3>
<p>Climate change influences air as ambient  air pollutants  are very sensitive to meteorological 
conditions.
</p>
<p>
Air quality is strongly dependent on weather and is therefore sensitive to climate change.<br> Recent studies have provided estimates of this climate effect through correlations of air quality with meteorological variables.

</p>
<p>How is air pollution affected by weather depends-- some types of pollution are worse in the summer heat, while others are worse in cold winter weather. <br>The same atmospheric conditions that create weather-- air pressure, temperature, and humidity-- also affect air quality.

</p>
<p>
Because of climate warming, the Earth experiences more extreme weather, such as heat waves and drought, which can negatively Impact air quality.
</p>


<h3>Purpose/Idea</h3>
<p>
The Purpose of this project is to use Meteorological variables for past  years data for a  and use them to predict the Air Quality Index  of a particular pollutant of a Particular region.

</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>
To predict the air quality index of a particular region , we need the <br>

pollutant concentration of a particular pollutant (PM 2.5  AQI) which will be available in the cpcb.nic.in website,

</p>
<p>

Historical Metereological Data which will  be collected from website en.tutiempo.net/

</p>
<h3>Techniques </h3>
  
<p>Feature  engineering </p>
<p>
Supervised Learning Algorithms  
(Linear Regression
Lasso and Ridge Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
KNN Regressor
Random Forest Regressor)
</p>
<h3>Targets </h3>
  
<p>BY  MIDWAY
 Collection of Data,
Preprocess the Data

Apply Different  Supervised  algorithms and Identify  which works  best
</p>
<p>
AFTER  MIDWAY
Suggest  possible  improvements
Report Writing 
</p>
<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>The  model should be capable for successfully predicting the air quality index of a total county or any state or any bounded region provided with the Metereological Data
